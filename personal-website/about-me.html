        <section class="product-item">

          <p>
            Prior to coding I was a piano and art instructor
            for 14 years at Anyamei Studios LLC.
          </p>

          <p>
            Teaching kids as young as 3 and as old as 78.
            I enjoy connecting with people from all walks of life.
            Living a life full of adventure and with many valuable
            perspectives and experiences along the way! <br>
          </p>

          <p>I am lucky to have found my curiosity at a young age.
            This helped me propel my self-taught studies with enthusiasm,
            one of the best traits to learn anything.</p>

          <p>Teaching myself piano at the age of 11 and helped others learn too.
            By age 12 I began getting paid for
            group and private classes! <br>
            Continuing to learn best teaching practices and business policies.
            Pursuing music competitions and events.
          </p>

          <p>
            At 15 years old I was fully committed in my educational career and
            dedicated 7 days a week to teaching.
          </p>

          <p>Running a studio kept me busy, but during my free time I enjoy going
            on many planned and spontaneous
            adventures. In 2021 I planned a solo carcamping roadtrip through 30 states.
            I improved my photography skills
            a bunch! <br></p>

          <p>Throughout my adventures, I search for connection within myself and others.
            Gaining new perspectives with each new experience. <br>
          </p>
