        <section class="product-item">

          <p>
            I have professionally taught private and group piano classes
            from 2011 to 2024 at my studio, Anyamei Studios LLC.
          </p>

          <p>
            Teaching kids as young as 3 and as old as 78.
            I enjoy connecting with people from all walks of life.
            Living a life full of adventure and with many valuable
            perspectives and experiences along the way! <br>

          </p>

          <br>
          <p>
            I am lucky to have found my curiosity at a young age.
            This helped me propel my self-taught studies with determination!
            I started teaching myself the piano at 11 years old.
          </p>

          <p>
            By age 12 I began getting paid for group
            and private classes! <br>
            Continuing to learn best teaching practices and business policies
            while pursuing music competitions and events.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            At 15 years old I was fully committed in my educational career and
            dedicated 7 days a week to teaching.
          </p>

          <p>
            During that time I taught close to 400 students,
            many reaching high success in various music competitions.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Some of my favorite students were the troubled adolescents
            that came from tough backgrounds.
            Music gave a voice to those children that felt unheard
            and who were too shy to speak.
            <br>
            Helping individuals find their voice through musical expressions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each student received a curated curriculum
            to meet their personal music goals. This allowed for more
            passionate performers to only play pieces they'd love!
          </p>
