# ABOUT ME
## I am a software developer that enjoys challenging work that creates meaningful impacts.
I started coding to create unique solutions to large problems.
            It is a very rewarding and exciting career! In our day-to-day lives,
            we are impacted by software in dozens of ways.
            By being a developer I can be a part of the impact of thousands
            of lives in small and large ways.
            I am lucky to have found my curiosity at a young age.
            This helped me propel my coding studies
            enthusiastically.

            As a dev, there are new things to discover every day.
            The combination of logic, creativity, and
            discovery, leads my passion for software and web development!

Prior to coding I was a piano and art instructor for 14 years at my studio, Anyamei Studios LLC.

During my free time I enjoy going on many planned and spontaneous adventures. In 2021 I planned a solo carcamping roadtrip through 30 states. I improved my photography skills a bunch! <br>

Throughout my adventures, I search for connection within myself and others. Gaining new perspectives with each new experience. <br>




I love all things creative. I can spend hours painting, coding, and teaching.

A few (*or more!*) things that I am deeply passionate about and enjoy:
- Software, hardware, games, reading, talking with friends, puzzles, learning, hiking, traveling, cultural exploration, cooking, TV shows, animals, design, art, music, swimming, kayaking, rowing, new experiences, and challenging myself.

## What do people have to say about me?


>**_Communicating_** - sharing openly about all aspects of life, asking questions of others due to
    > genuine interest, being an _encourager_ and builder of others self-concept, listening actively
        > and having _empathy_; articulating thoughts clearly.

>**_Bravery_** - being willing to try new things and shift gears in life; seeking knowledge and
    >craving the chance to learn; demonstrating _perseverance_ through difficult obstacles that
        >get in the way.

>**_Thought-provoking_** - being insightful enough to challenge the thinking of others and encourage different viewpoints; not afraid to go against the grain or march to your own beat.

>**_Discenerment_**, \
you will sit with the feedback and opinions from others and reflect on it. Not concrete (You are _curious_ about others and yourself).

>**_Hardworking_**, \
You have absolutely shown a tremendous amount of responsibility and to have bought your own house at 18, ran it, and fixed it, forget the fact that you worked for it and bought it yourself, that showed a tremendous amount of _hardwork_.

>**_Very unique_**, \
There is not another Anya out there. I think in some of these roles, there are a lot of people who are kind of going to do the job the same way. I don't think too many people could do the job the way you're going to do the job.

# ART
My favorite color as a kid was black. That might seem sad, right? In reality, my favorite color was black because it was the combination of all the colors. <br>
I was not the kid to paint rainbows, I instead painted black pages that to me, were the best rainbows a girl could ask for.

I have worked in many mediums with my favorites being:
- Sculptural Acrylic Paint
- Copic Alcohol Markers
- Digital with Procreate, Vectornator, and Figma
- Prismacolor and Fabercastel Colored pencils

# MUSIC


I am the CEO of Anyamei Studios LLC and have professionally taught private and group piano classes from 2011 to 2024.

Teaching kids as young as 3 and as old as 78.
I enjoy connecting with people from all walks of life.
Living a life full of adventure and with many valuable perspectives and experiences along the way! <br>

I am lucky to have found my curiosity at a young age. This helped me propel my self-taught studies enthusiastically, one of the best traits to learn anything.

Teaching myself piano at the age of 11 and helped others learn too. By age 12 I began getting paid for group and private classes! <br>
Continuing to learn best teaching practices and business policies. Pursuing music competitions and events.

At 15 years old I was fully committed in my educational career and dedicated 7 days a week to teaching.


During that time I taught close to 400 students, many reaching high success in various music competitions.

Some of my favorite students were the troubled adolescents that came from tough backgrounds. Music gave a voice to those children that felt unheard and who were too shy to speak.
Helping individuals find their voice through musical expressions.

Each student received a curated curriculum to meet their personal music goals. This allowed for more passionate performers to only play pieces they'd love!

## Music events

   - Students participating in Piano Solos National Federation of Music Clubs achieved an **88% Superior rate** on average including Music Theory tests.

   - Students placed as finalists for Piano Solo Scholarship NFMC and Solo Auditions for Charlotte Piano Teachers Forum.

   ## Titles
Director of the State Division for Piano and Vocals at North Carolina's Music Teachers Association, a non-profit, since 2022

Judge for the National Federation of Music Clubs since 2019.

I have impacted the Piano Teacher community by having 3 of my students participate in my Music Teacher Program for the young. \
Each created their own successful music studio.
