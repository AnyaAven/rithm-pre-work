# Planning your Career Transition - Questions Worksheet

Here are some prompts to get you thinking about your career transition.

## 1. What is my motivation to change my situation?
I'd like to create the career that suits me best, a career that I can be passionate about, and that I can grow and make a sizeable impact.\
    I am motivated to have more flexibility with locations and a more stable source of income.\
    I am currently self-employed and would prefer working on a team. I also would like to steer away from the constant customer service that comes with my work.

Software development meets all of these requirements for me and has the bonus of being already within my network!

- ### What am I running away from?
    From making choices out of fear.\
    I believe choices should be made with hope.

- ### What am I running toward?
    To a fulfilling career in software.


## 2. What do I need to invest my courage and efforts in?
I need to have continuous courage to try new things and to speak up. \
Putting great effort into learning efficiently.

- ### What specific actions do I need to take to make progress in the direction I have intended?
- Take clear concise notes.
- Using Jira, create clear goals and evaluate subgoals.
- Create an online network, integrating my current network.


## 3. What lights me up?
I love all things creative! I can spend hours painting, teaching, and having deep conversations with friends.

Flowstate is something that I consistently try to achieve for myself.

A few (*or more!*) things that I am deeply passionate about and enjoy:
- Software, hardware, games, reading, talking with friends, puzzles, learning, hiking, traveling, cultural exploration, cooking, TV shows, animals, design, art, music, swimming, kayaking, rowing, new experiences, and challenging myself.


## 4. What am I great at?
I am great at **_connecting_** with people from all walks of life. \
    I have lived a very unique life that has led me to have many valuable perspectives. I love to learn other people's perspectives and reflect on them as well.

By being curious about others I have been able to be more _empathetic_, understand the _vulnerability_ it takes to be _brave_, and how to communicate better.

I am an extremely **_curious_** person.\
    I am lucky to have found my curiosity at a young age as well. This helped me propel my self-taught studies with enthusiasm, one of the best traits to learn anything.

I have great **_organizational_** skills and **_dedication_**.\
    I taught myself piano at the age of 11. By age 12 I became a piano teacher and taught music theory group classes with 10 - 15 students. I also started private 1 on 1 classes with grades K - 12 and adult classes.

I am a great **_researcher_**.\
    Researched and developed my own curriculum to set me apart from the other piano teachers. Being so young starting a career was challenging, but I also used this to my advantage by being more relatable to teenagers without sacrificing their music education.\

**_Dedicated_**,
    At age 15 I was fully committed in my educational career and dedicated 7 days a week to teaching.

I am great at **_learning_** and **_adapting_**.
    I continued to learn best teaching practices and business policies. Pursuing music competitions and events.

I am proud to have saved up enough money through my business to buy a house at age 18, creating a stable home and successful home studio.

I am a great **businesswoman**, a great **friend**, and a great **learner**.


- ### What do people I have worked with before say about me? What strengths do they recognize in me?

    >**_Communicating_** - sharing openly about all aspects of life, asking questions of others due to
        > genuine interest, being an _encourager_ and builder of others self-concept, listening actively
        > and having _empathy_; articulating thoughts clearly.

    >**_Bravery_** - being willing to try new things and shift gears in life; seeking knowledge and
        >craving the chance to learn; demonstrating _perseverance_ through difficult obstacles that
        >get in the way.

    >**_Thought-provoking_** - being insightful enough to challenge the thinking of others and encourage different viewpoints; not afraid to go against the grain or march to your own beat.

    >**_Discenerment_**, \
    you will sit with the feedback and opinions from others and reflect on it. Not concrete (You are _curious_ about others and yourself).

    >**_Hardworking_**, \
    You have absolutely shown a tremendous amount of responsibility and to have bought your own house at 18, ran it, and fixed it, forget the fact that you worked for it and bought it yourself, that showed a tremendous amount of _hardwork_.

    >**_Very unique_**, \
    There is not another Anya out there. I think in some of these roles, there are a lot of people who are kind of going to do the job the same way. I don't think too many people could do the job the way you're going to do the job.


    >You will take risks, but you're _not reckless_.

    >You didn't have a traditional life which led to gaps in experience, but I've never seen someone work so hard to close those gaps like you have.

    **Strong, resilient, and independent.**


## 5. What are my values?
- Making A Difference
- Teamwork
- Support
- Reliability

- Authenticity

- Timeliness


## 6. What has been my work journey so far?

I am the CEO of Anyamei Studios LLC and have professionally taught private and group piano classes from 2011 to 2024.

During this time I have taught close to 400 students, many reaching high success in various music competitions.

   - Students participating in Piano Solos National Federation of Music Clubs achieved an **88% Superior rate** on average including Music Theory tests.

   - Students placed as finalists for Piano Solo Scholarship NFMC and Solo Auditions for Charlotte Piano Teachers Forum.

Director of the State Division for Piano and Vocals at North Carolina's Music Teachers Association, a non-profit, since 2022

Judge for the National Federation of Music Clubs since 2019.

I have impacted the Piano Teacher community by having 3 of my students participate in my Music Teacher Program for the young. \
Each created their own successful music studio.


## 7. How do I define success?

I believe success is determined by the individual with the standard being set for each new goal.\
    Each goal can have subgoals as well that create a more successful success.\
    **_Goal:_** "I want to become a software developer"\
    **_SubGoal:_** "I would like to acquire a SWE position in 6 months"

I also believe some goals have mandatory subgoals.\
    **_Goal_**: "I would like to retire"\
    **_Subgoal_**: "I need a retirement account with enough funds to sustain my living style"

Not everyone has the same goals and path to their success. I have personally identified my goals and have achieved great success by accomplishing some of them throughout my life.

I am looking forward to much more success while knowing great success comes with many failures.


## 8. What do I need to be successful?

I need to be realistic with my vision of my goals. I am quite ambitious, enjoy challenging work, and often will thread the line between that and what is realistic. A balance!\
For me to be successful, I need to focus, remain structured, and keep up the energy to absorb a lot of new skills.\
Being mindful that I will be entering into quite a few new territories and it's okay not to be the best... _yet_!

- ### What am I willing to let go to get what I want?

    Lack of community and fixed location.

- ### What am I not willing to let go to get what I want?

    The integrity of my values, my autonomy, time for myself, and opportunities to grow in my new field.


## 9. Do I have a clear vision for what I want next?

**_My dream job:_**\
I would love to work on a small team as a full-stack developer.\
    I enjoy leadership and would love to improve the team's community and spirit. \
    A remote position would be ideal for the flexibility of travel. With a sizeable vacation time to explore and have great adventures.\
    I would prefer a contract or salary role. The job would consist of meaningful impactful work, regardless of the type of field.\
    The types of fields that I am currently interested in are education, music theory software, trust and safety, or a non-profit organization.


## 10. Am I ready for the ride?

**YES!** I am excited about this journey! I want this and I know I have the skills to achieve it and be very successful. \
I have achieved very hard things before and I am that much more ready to do it again, this time, with even more growth and skills under my belt.

- ### What am I going to enjoy during this career transition process?

    I have enjoyed the teachers and alumni along the way and will continue to enjoy meeting new people along the way.
    I'll enjoy solving problems with people, creating unique solutions, and learning how to grow from one another.
    I enjoy tinkering with technology and am excited to see how that develops as my software concepts grow.


- ### What do I need to pay special attention to during the career transition process?

    _Feedback_.
    I believe that will always be the most valuable thing to hear. \
    It's important to me that I sit with the feedback and reflect on what I can take away from it. \
    Both technically, personally, and emotionally. People are very complicated and I am not entering into only a stagnant robotic world, I am entering into an evergrowing world, filled with emotions, unique people, and all their experiences.
